# GA World Wind Suite - webstart preview applications #

This repository contains JNLP webstart descriptors for a few of the projects in the `ga-worldwind-suite` repository.

Click the following links to preview the applications:
* [Viewer](https://raw.github.com/ga-m3dv/ga-worldwind-webstart/master/Webstart/jnlp/viewer.jnlp)
* [Animator](https://raw.github.com/ga-m3dv/ga-worldwind-webstart/master/Webstart/jnlp/animator.jnlp)

As of Java 7 update 51, Oracle changed the security policy to disable self-signed webstart apps by default. Both of the webstart links above contain self-signed JARs, so you will need to either change the Java security level to Medium, or add the URL to the list of exception sites (see the Security tab in the Java Control Panel).

See the [ga-worldwind-suite](https://github.com/ga-m3dv/ga-worldwind-suite) respository for more information and the source code.
